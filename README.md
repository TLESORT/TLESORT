Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm TimothÃ©e Lesort, a Senior Data Scientist at [Aignostics GmbH](https://www.aignostics.com/) in Berlin. My work focuses on training large-scale self-supervised vision models for histopathology (mostly tweaking Dinov2 training), aiming to improve cancer and rare disease diagnostics ( or at least the numbers in the benchmarks ðŸ™ƒ ).

My expertise lies in deep learning for vision and language, with a strong interest in continual learning and representation learning for robust generalization and efficient scaling.

Previously, I conducted postdoctoral research at [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/), [Mila â€“ Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) under the supervision of [Irina Rish](https://mila.quebec/en/person/irina-rish/), where I worked on large-scale continual [pretraining of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04014) (large language models).

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from [IP Paris - Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) (France) in the [U2IS lab](http://u2is.ensta-paris.fr/) under the supervision of [David Filliat](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Filliat). My doctoral research, titled "[Continual Learning: Tackling Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Neural Networks with Replay Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00487)," investigated the use of replay mechanisms, particularly generative models, for continual learning. I also explored replay for continual reinforcement learning and the theoretical limitations of regularizing dynamic architectures in continual learning. I hold a Master's degree in Electronics and Robotics from CPE Lyon.

I love train ðŸšž and bike ðŸš² travelling, big trees ðŸŒ³ and playing chess â™Ÿ
